# Black-Friday-Sales

In this project I have done EDA of the features that tend towards purchase in Black Friday, in one pyhton file.

Analysis of EDA:
-Most Populated Age Group is 26-25 years
- More Males than Females
- Occupation number 0 and 4 employ the most customers.
- Occupation number 8 and 9 employ the least customers.
- Most Customers are from City B
- Majority of Customers are Unmarried
- Most customers are living in the city for 1 years
- Age wise the mean purchase is of around 8000(currency)
- There is a direct correlation with number of customers and
amount spent .



In the other python file, I will apply Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts to create prediction.
